## MongoDB + Node = Mongoose (an intro)

I love the smell of queries in the morning.

At long last we're going to see how to hook Node up to a database.  While there are probably some apps that don't need to store their own data, it'll still expand the range of possibilities to learn how to hook our event-driven I/O to a database.

We're going to use MongoDB, and we'll access MongoDB through the great ODM Mongoose.  ODM stands for "Object-Document Mapper".  If you've heard of an ORM before, an ODM is like that but for document-based stores like MongoDB.  Mongoose will give us some convenient abstractions for working with our MongoDB objects.

This is just a primer on Mongoose.  Like a few of the other things we've covered, it's way too much to tackle in a single episode.  So be sure to tune in next week too, when we get to more powerful features like using indexes and data validation.
